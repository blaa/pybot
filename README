**
* Generic command execution framework.
**

It reads commands using one of it's frontends, parses and passes 
to backend which executes them somehow. Two frontends and two 
backends are implemented currently: console frontend, jabber-bot frontend,
shell execution backend and MySQL/SQL backend.

- Commands form a tree, eg.:
      mail                 service
     /   \                /       \
 user     alias          mysql     postfix
   / \         \        /     \           \
add   change   add    status   restart     flushqueue

Leaf commands can take arguments:
mail user add    username         Frank     password ElisabethXIII domain kingdom.uk
^^^^^^^^^^^^^    ^^^^^^^^         ^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  Command     Argument keyword  Arg. value                etc.

Or no arguments at all:
service mysql restart

First (in example commands.xml) is changed to SQL command, second executes /etc/init.d/mysql restart
and returns it's result.


- There may be many access levels to services (in jabber frontend)


Usage:
You will want to edit commands.xml and config.py. For console use just try:
./pybot.py <command>
